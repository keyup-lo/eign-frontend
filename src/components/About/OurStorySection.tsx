                  Eign was born from a simple, powerful idea: real estate shouldn't rely on guesswork.

                <p className='text-sm'>
                  In fast-growing cities across the MENA region, location data is fragmented, outdated, or simply invisible. As urban transformation accelerates, decision-makers need better tools.
                </p>
                
                <p className='text-sm'>
                  So we built Eign: a location intelligence engine that translates complexity into insight. Using AI, satellite imaging, and verified local data, we created a comprehensive urban analysis platform that turns into one clear source of truth for location value.
